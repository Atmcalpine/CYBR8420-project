## **Project: [IT Flow](https://github.com/itflow-org/itflow)**

**Operational Environment:** MSPs Are widely used by small to medium sized businesses. Small to medium sized busnesses become easy targets for low-risk-low-reward attacks. The most widely known MSP is ITGlue. ITFLow is the open source version of that software.

**Threats Percieved by Users:**

**List of Security Features:**

**Motivations:**  MSP software is vital to hundres of small to medium sized companies. It is likely many are not able to afford something like ITGlue. ITFlow is an open-source solution to smller, growing businesses. Our team memeber, Corey Mekelberg, works with MSPs professionally and has a good understanding of how they work and what kind of security they need. We hope this will be an excellant contribution to Quality Assurance of the open source project.
