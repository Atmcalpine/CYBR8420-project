## **Tenative Project: https://github.com/Pythagora-io/gpt-pilot**

**Operational Environment:** Enterprise

**Motivations:** We are all intrested in AI and the impact that it can have on the security posture of the enterprise. 

**What is it:** This is a research project to see how can GPT-4 be utilized to generate fully working, production-ready, apps. The main idea is that AI can write most of the code for an app (maybe 95%) but for the rest 5%, a developer is and will be needed until we get full AGI.

**Contributors:** Small team comprised of 15 people. 

**Discord:** [Project Server](https://discord.com/invite/FWnRZdCb)

There has been no security incidents with this open source project because it is so new.
